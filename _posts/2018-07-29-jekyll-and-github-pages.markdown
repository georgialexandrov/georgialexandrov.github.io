For many years I've been experimenting with many ways to host a website. 

I started in 2003 with free hosting supporting only HTML/CSS websites. Later on, I tried Raspberry Pi next to my router, VPS, Cloud solutions and recently Intel NUC.

For the last couple of years I was considering starting a blog and a few weeks ago I started looking for a good solution. I wanted something simple, easy to configure, easy to support, stable and as safe from hackers as modern web software can be.

I will write less than few posts per month so I don't need anything like WordPress and I don't need any database. 

The final criteria were:

- does not need a database server;
- can generate static web pages;
- can be hosted for free somewhere with my domain;

I was on my way to start node.js blog platform when I found [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"}. It's not something hard to find, because Jekyll is powering GitHub Pages for years, but I never think of it.

In short, Jekyll is Ruby-based solution for converting markdown files into static HTML pages. Changing themes is quite easy, there is good support for plugins and tutorials over the Internet. Of course, in case I need something fancy I can write HTML instead of markdown.

## Starting with Jekyll

First I need Ruby. MacOS has it by default, but I use newer version through [RVM](https://rvm.io){:target="_blank"}. Another option is [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv){:target="_blank"}.

Installing Jekyll is quite easy as written on the homepage:

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install bundler jekyll
$ jekyll new my-awesome-site
$ cd my-awesome-site
/my-awesome-site $ bundle exec jekyll serve
# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
{% endhighlight %}

### Writing content

The index page and all the static pages can be placed in the root directory. Blog posts are stored in _posts. This convention is needed because Jekyll is scanning the directories to find what to be rendered. When the browser requires `/about`, Jekyll is searching for `about.html` or `about.md` in the home directory.

The same applies to blog posts. When a browser is requesting the entry point for the blog, Jekyll needs to know which files to parse and which pages to show.

Every page starts with metadata, e.g. for this page in the first lines I have:

{% highlight yml %}

{% endhighlight %}
This way Jekyll knows which layout to parse, what title to show in the browser and [more](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/){:target="_blank}. 

### Customizing the layout

Changing theme requires just two steps:

1. install the theme through `gem`
2. change the `theme` setting in _config.yml

List of themes is available [here](https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=âœ“&query=jekyll-theme){:target="_blank"}

In my case, I wanted to build something custom to refresh my HTML/CSS knowledge so I ended having few files in `_layout`, `_includes` and `/assets/css`. More on custom theme can be found in the [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/){:target="_blank}.

After choosing Jekyll the answer to my hosting solution was clear. Why pay for hosting when I can deploy my blog to GitHub Pages?

## How to host a website in GitHub Pages

GitHub pages are just an HTML view of the GitHub repos in `*.github.io` subdomain. To open a homepage with format `username.github.io`, GitHub pages is looking for a repo with the same name in `username`'s profile.

In my case I have [georgialexandrov.github.io](http://github.com/georgialexandrov/georgialexandrov.github.io){:target="_blank"}

That's all required to have github.io website. Even simple README.md is enough to have something online.

Now every repo with enabled GitHub pages documentation will be available in `username.github.io/repo-name`. The main website requires the website to be in the master branch, but for all the other repos there are 3 options:
- `master` branch;
- `docs` folder in the master branch;
- `gh-pages` branch;

Adding a custom domain is quite easy. It requires just a file with name `CNAME` in the repository. The content is just the domain name, in my case:

{% highlight text %}
georgialexandrov.eu
{% endhighlight %}

An alternative solution to add the domain name is the repository `Settings` page. In both cases the end result will be just a `CNAME` file:

![ScreenShot ](/assets/posts/img/github-custom-domain.png "GitHub Custom Domain")

Once having the domain added I needed to configure `A` records with the DNS provider to point to GitHub Pages DNS IPs, which at the time of writing this blog post are:

- 185.199.108.153
- 185.199.109.153
- 185.199.110.153
- 185.199.111.153

For actual IPs better check [GitHub Help page](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/){:target="_blank"}  

The change may take up to 24 hours to take effect, but changing the computer or router DNS settings to `1.1.1.1` can force the refresh.
