  <h1>Technologies</h1>

  <p>
    My technology choices center on architectural patterns that reduce cognitive
    overhead while maintaining flexibility. After building systems that need to
    evolve under changing requirements, I've learned that the most valuable
    tools embed good organizational patterns rather than just providing more
    features.
  </p>

  <h2>Development Philosophy</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Full-Stack ownership</strong> I've learned that full-stack ownership
    works better than role separation, though it took me years to understand why.
    Early in my career, I'd write beautiful backend APIs only to discover weeks later
    that the frontend team needed completely different data structures, or that my
    elegant caching logic was useless because deployment constraints made it impossible
    to configure properly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem isn't individual competence—it's information flow. When you hand
    off work between specialists, you're essentially playing a game of telephone
    with technical requirements. Each handoff loses context about why decisions
    were made and what constraints actually matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now I prefer developers who can take a feature from requirements discussion
    through Docker deployment and production monitoring. Not because they need
    to be experts at everything, but because ownership of the complete cycle
    creates immediate feedback loops. When you're the one getting paged at 2 AM
    because your caching strategy is thrashing the database, you learn to think
    differently about performance optimizations during development.
  </p>
  <p>
    This connects to the Software Craftsmanship idea that developers should
    engage with the "why" behind requirements. When you're responsible for
    production behavior, you naturally ask better questions during planning
    because you'll own the consequences. Teams structured this way develop
    better technical judgment because decisions have immediate, visible outcomes
    rather than getting lost in handoff abstractions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>NestJS for Backend Architecture</strong> NestJS provides the architectural
    patterns I value most: dependency injection for clean component boundaries and
    a module system that can mirror Domain-Driven Design bounded contexts. This brings
    code organization closer to the actual business domain, making the system easier
    to understand and maintain for both current and future team members.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>React for Frontend Simplicity</strong> React's component model aligns
    with how I think about maintainable interfaces. The framework's emphasis on functional
    components and predictable state management reduces the cognitive overhead of
    understanding UI behavior. When components are truly isolated, interface complexity
    scales gracefully without tight coupling between presentation and business logic.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>AI-Enhanced Development Workflows</strong> I'm currently leading AI transformation
    initiatives focused on maintaining context continuity from client meetings through
    development and QA processes. This isn't about replacing human judgment but augmenting
    team capabilities with better information flow. When AI systems maintain project
    context across phases, teams make more informed decisions and catch inconsistencies
    earlier in the development cycle.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current SDLC implementation integrates logging, monitoring, alerting, and
    CI/CD through GitHub Actions. This isn't just about automation—it's about
    creating feedback loops that surface issues before they impact users. When
    development workflows include observability from the beginning, teams
    develop better intuition about system behavior and can make more informed
    architectural decisions.
  </p>

  <h2>Why These Choices Matter</h2>
  <p>
    I prioritize technologies that create compound advantages over time. When
    your development stack makes testing easier, code reviews more meaningful,
    and deployments more reliable, these improvements combine into significant
    differences in team capability and system reliability. The goal is building
    development environments where good practices become the path of least
    resistance.
