  <h1>Technologies</h1>
  <p>During my experience, I worked with php, node.js, and java. I also supported many systems in production.</p>

  <h2>Node.js</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hapi</strong> is web framework I use the most in node.js;</li>
    <li><strong>Mocha</strong> is great coffee and great framework which I use whenever I can;</li>
    <li><strong>React</strong> is what I choose when I need front end;</li>
    <li><strong>Redux</strong> with React is like Batman and Robin;</li>
    <li><strong>Immutable</strong> saves me when working with Redux;</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>PHP</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>cakePHP</strong> was the first framework I used for php;</li>
    <li><strong>Laravel</strong> is my favorite php framework;</li>
    <li><strong>Doctrine</strong> is nice ORM when such need to be used in php;</li>
    <li><strong>composer</strong> is the most important thing for last the 10 years in php world;</li>
    <li><strong>phpUnit</strong> is a must for every project;</li>
    <li><strong>Symfony</strong> components I use anytime I can;</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Java</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spring</strong> was the first framework I ever used back in 2007;</li>
    <li><strong>Play</strong>! Framework was the last web framework I used when I was in the Java world;</li>
    <li><strong>jUnit</strong> saved me many times on many projects;</li>
    <li><strong>Hibernate</strong> was used by me for a project which was searching in a database with 600k users;</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>OS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>MacOS</strong> is my first choice for a work machine;</li>
    <li><strong>Linux</strong> (centOS or Ubuntu) is what I choose for hosting when I support systems in production;</li>
    <li><strong>Windows</strong> is something I prefer to avoid;</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Other</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Jenkins</strong> is CI which I implemented to build and deploy java on Linux, .net on windows worker and iOS for running automated tests on devices;</li>
    <li><strong>SonarQube</strong> is my choice for implementing continuous improvement techniques and action plans for PHP and Java;</li>
    <li><strong>Capistrano</strong> is what I used for deploying PHP applications in production;</li>
    <li><strong>Puppet</strong> is a solution for provisioning which I choose to implement provisioning for 80+ servers in production;</li>
    <li><strong>Vagrant</strong> provisioned with Puppet is something I used before Docker was cool;</li>
    <li><strong>Docker</strong> will be my solution instead of vagrant if I need to fix "work on my machine" problem now;</li>
  </ul>
