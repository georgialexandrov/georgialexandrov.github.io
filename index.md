# Vision
I like Robert C. Martin's definition for professionalism and software craftsman:

TDD must be used to be able to prove the software works at any time
people must try to leave everything a bit cleaner than they found it. Sounds easy, but it's not :-)
automation everywhere
continuous improvement
As team lead I believe team members should have clear tasks right for their skills when they come to work in the morning. The perfect task is the one with clear end result, a bit challenging which allows the developer to take all the decisions about the implementation.

As can be seen in this website I believe in minimalism

I signed the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto

# Technologies
During my experience I worked with php, node.js and java. I also supported many systems in production.

Node.js

Hapi is web framework I use the most in node.js;
Mocha is great coffee and great framework which I use whenever I can;
React is what I choose when I need front end;
Redux with React is like Batman and Robin;
Immutable saves me when working with Redux;
PHP

cakePHP was the first framework I used for php;
Laravel is my favourite php framework;
Doctrine is nice ORM when such need to be used in php;
composer is the most important thing for last 10 years in php world;
phpUnit is a must for every project;
Symfony components I use anytime I can;
Java

Spring was the first framework I ever used back in 2007;
Play! Framework was the last web framework I used when I was in the Java world;
jUnit saved me many times in many projects;
Hibernate was used by me for a project which was searching in database with 600k users;
OS

MacOS is my first choise for work machine;
Linux (centOS or ubuntu) is what I choose for hosting when I support systems in production;
Windows is something I prefer to avoid;
Other

Jenkins is CI which I implemented to build and deploy java on linux, .net on windows worker and iOS for running automated tests on devices;
SonarQube is my choice for implementing continuous improvement techniques and action plans for PHP and Java;
Capistrano is what I used for deploying PHP applications in production;
Puppet is solution for provisioning which I choose to implement provisioning for 80+ servers in production;
Vagrant provisioned with Puppet is something I used before Docker was cool;
Docker will be my solution instead of vagrant if I need to fix "work on my machine" problem now;
