# Technologies
During my experience I worked with php, node.js and java. I also supported many systems in production.

## Node.js

- **Hapi** is web framework I use the most in node.js;
- **Mocha** is great coffee and great framework which I use whenever I can;
- **React** is what I choose when I need front end;
- **Redux** with React is like Batman and Robin;
- **Immutable** saves me when working with Redux;
## PHP

- **cakePHP** was the first framework I used for php;
- **Laravel** is my favourite php framework;
- **Doctrine** is nice ORM when such need to be used in php;
- **composer** is the most important thing for last 10 years in php world;
- **phpUnit** is a must for every project;
- **Symfony** components I use anytime I can;

## Java

- **Spring** was the first framework I ever used back in 2007;
- **Play**! Framework was the last web framework I used when I was in the Java world;
- **jUnit** saved me many times in many projects;
- **Hibernate** was used by me for a project which was searching in database with 600k users;

## OS

- **MacOS** is my first choise for work machine;
- **Linux** (centOS or ubuntu) is what I choose for hosting when I support systems in production;
- **Windows** is something I prefer to avoid;

## Other

- **Jenkins** is CI which I implemented to build and deploy java on linux, .net on windows worker and iOS for running automated tests on devices;
- **SonarQube** is my choice for implementing continuous improvement techniques and action plans for PHP and Java;
- **Capistrano** is what I used for deploying PHP applications in production;
- **Puppet** is solution for provisioning which I choose to implement provisioning for 80+ servers in production;
- **Vagrant** provisioned with Puppet is something I used before Docker was cool;
- **Docker** will be my solution instead of vagrant if I need to fix "work on my machine" problem now;
