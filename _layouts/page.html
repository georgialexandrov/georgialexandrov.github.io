                          <h1>Vision</h1>
                          <p>I like Robert C. Martin's definition for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0O1VVqRSK0" target="_blank">professionalism</a> and software craftsman:</p>
                          <ul>
                              <li>TDD must be used to be able to prove the software works at any time</li>
                              <li>people must try to leave everything a bit cleaner than they found it. Sounds easy, but it's not :-)</li>
                              <li>automation everywhere</li>
                              <li>continuous improvement</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>As team lead I believe team members should have clear tasks right for their skills when they come to work in the morning. The perfect task is the one with clear end result, a bit challenging which allows the developer to take all the decisions about the implementation.</p>
                          <p>As can be seen in this website I believe in <strong>minimalism</strong></p>
